  <h1>Step 2: Explore the Target Website</h1>

  <p>
    Explore the website to understand its purpose, functionality, and use. This step helps you determine which web pages to use for the evaluation in the next steps. Identify the web technologies used to provide the website and, if you want, take
    notes on other aspects of the website. Usually it is best to get input from the website owners and developers for this step. More guidance on this step is provided in
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/#step2">WCAG-EM Step 2: Explore the Target Website</a>.
